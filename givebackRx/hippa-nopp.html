Examples include software or technology vendors we may utilize to provide technical support, attorneys providing legal services to us, accountants, consultants, billing and collection companies, and others. When such a service is contracted, we may share your protected health information with such business associates and may allow our business associates to create, receive, maintain, disclose, or transmit your information on our behalf in order for the business associate to provide services to us, or for the proper management and administration of the business associate or to enable the business associate to fulfill its legal responsibilities. Business associates must protect any health information they receive from, or create and maintain on our behalf. In addition, business associates may re-disclose your health information for their own proper management and administration, to fulfill their legal responsibilities, and to business associates that are subcontractors in order for the subcontractors to provide services to the business associate. The subcontractors will be subject to the same restrictions and conditions that apply to the business associate. Whenever such an arrangement involves the use or disclosure of your information to our business associate, we will have a written contract with our business associate that contains terms designed to protect the privacy of your information.</li>
					<li><b>De-identified information</b> - We may use and disclose your health information to create de-identified information or limited data sets, and may use and disclose such information as permitted by law.</li>
